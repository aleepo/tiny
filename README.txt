The only dependency this project has is the google yapf formatter tool.
 To use it, enable a python virtual environment (if that is still a thing whenever you are reading this)
 then install yapf with pip (if that still exists) then run the tool with the `-i` flag to enable in-place formatting.

NOTE: This project does not use the yapf tool anywhere in the code, it is to be used explicitly as a CLI tool like clang-format.
